Quite a few changes since last time:

- I added a second MP10 on the left hand side to increase the flow. I'm now not sure that was necessary but more on that later.

- I have added ZeoMix to the reactor. It now

- I have added a bag Phosguard in the Sump in order to reduce phostphate levels. I appears to be working

- I have bought new corals
  - fireworks Clove Polyps
  - Forest Fire Montipora Digitata
  - Torch Coral

- I have added a pictus blenny which I have not seen since a few days after being introduced to the tank.

Issues:
- Awk, the orchid dottyback, was being a bit shy and I noticed it is getting discolored with maybe some scale issues. This is possible flukes, although the fish doesn;t actually flash. My other fish appear perfectly fine. As it could be flukes, I did a treatment of Fluke-solve.
