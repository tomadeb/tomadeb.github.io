This post will likely be a little different from what I have written before. Like a lot people, a lot of things have changed for me in 2020. My memory for this kind of things is not as good as I wish. That's why I have decided to write it down. What follows is a summary of the last 14 months and how it affected me and my family.

### January February 2020
We first started hearing of and discussing [Coronavirus disease 2019][1] (COVID-19) early January. Some of our extended family from France was still in the UK after having spent the festive period with us. The news were reporting a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. None of us had any concerns yet. We were looking forward to 2020, expecially the ski holiday and the cruise, scheduled for February and April respectively.    

Fast-forward a few weeks, the ski holiday in France did happen but the mood was a little bit diferent than usual. Cases had started to be reported in Europe. Italy had suspended all flights to and from China. France had a few cases too and the local news were reporting that a school, not far from where we were staying, had confirmed cases and was shutting down temporarily. From the beginning of our stay in France, the people with whom we were skiing were concerned about the possibility of getting infected, of a pandemic and, more generally, of the future. I must admit that at this point, I was fairly dismissive of the attention the media was giving to the virus.

We returned to United Kingdom on Sunday February 16th. The kids went back to school and we went back to work as usual. While I was away, things had happened at work. A colleague had recently returned from a business trip to APAC and was quarantining himself. Some colleagues had started to voice their concern about their safety and others' in light of the virus. A few colleagues were keen to consider working from home on a long term basis, but the organisation had not made any decision yet.

The following two weeks were practically business-as-usual. I was asked to consider the practicalities of working from home for my team in the event of large-scale request to send people home. Our collegaues in APAC invoked their business continuity plan and started a split-office position.

We went to London on Friday February 28th for the weekend. London was as it has always been, except maybe for a few mask-wearing travellers on the tube. With hindsight, it was a bit foolish really, we went to the Natural History Museum, saw a West-end show ... Social distancing was not yet a thing.

I got a call from my boss while on the train to London. We were asked to invoke the plan prepared earlier and the majority of my team was to start working from home until further notice. I was instructed not to go to the office under any circumstances. My badge had been deactivated. If I needed anything, it would need to be posted or courriered.

### March to July 2020

So I started working from home 5 days a week. I am used to working from home and geographically remote from my team. It has been part of my work routine for the best part of a decade. I do not mind working form home and I even enjoy it. I find that I am a lot more productive when I have more control over my schedule. I also enjoy some things which are usually frowned upon in open plan offices (a clicky keyboard, music, etc, ...). So the transition to working at home full time was not difficult for me. I have dedicated study space in my house where I can have privacy and work without waking up the entire house. I honestly thought this would last a few weeks; but here I am 12 months later and I have not set foot in the office since.

The situation deteriorated rapidly in France in early March. We had reports of increasing numbers of deaths and cases by our friends and family there. Lockdown measures in France were announced by President Macron on March 16th.

That same day and after careful considerations, I took the decision to get the kids out of school. A few other parents had made the same decision. My reasoning was that most countries seemed to have waited too long before implementing strict measures to tackle the virus. I felt it was the best thing to do.

My partner works in healthcare in a large hospital in England. She did not have the option to work from home at the time, so it meant that I was at home with the kids. doing my full time job and looking after the kids. Home schooling was not the absolute focus nor priority. Kids played a lot together. We quickly took the habit of going for a bike ride for lunch as our daily authorised exercise outside. Kids enjoyed it; we made the most of what we had.

Schools partialy reopened in July. Kid #1 went for 2 days over 2 weeks; Kid #2 went for 4 days over 4 weeks. It was weird to be alone at home again. When they were not at school, we continued to go on bike rides and play board games.

I think it's important to note that work at that time was also insanely busy. I was recruiting for several roles in my team, handling day-to-day operations and participating in several expansion-related projects due to the number of staff working from home.

There were no travel restrictions between UK and France in July, so we decided to go on our holiday and see our family.
