Hello,

My name is thomas and I thank you for visiting this site.


This website is the latest in a series of failed attempts, which started in the early 2000s, to maintain a blog. I don't really have a plan for this site except as an opportunity to write creatively and store "stuff" which may be of interest to others.


In real life, I am a father-of-two partner-of-one who works in cybersecurity for a large organisation. I grew up in France and emigrated to United Kingdom at the age of 21. I am a big fan of technology and started <del>[copying BASIC code from magazines][1]</del> coding on an [Amstrad CP6128][2] at the age of 10. I have been lucky enough to say that work has been more or a passion or hobby than anything else. In previous jobs, I have administered Unix and Linux machines, maintained firewalls, deployed applications throughout Europe. Now I lead the Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) in EMEA for a global organisation. Most days, I love my job.

I have several hobbies, but I particularly enjoy playing board games, building legos, watching movies and snowboarding.

I hope you enjoy your visit here and find something useful to you.
