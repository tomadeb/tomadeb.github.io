Hello,

My name is thomas and I thank you for visiting this site.


This website is the latest in a series of failed attempts, which started in the early 2000s, to maintain a blog. I don't really have a plan for this site except as an opportunity to write creatively and store "stuff" which may be of interest to others.

In real life, I work in cybersecurity for a large organisation in the UK. I grew up in France and emigrated about 20 years ago. I am a big fan of technology and started <del>[copying BASIC code from magazines][1]</del> coding on an [Amstrad CP6128][2] at the age of 10. I am lucky that work has been more of a passion than anything else. In previous jobs, I have played with UNIX and Linux servers, maintained firewalls and deployed security applications. 

I have several hobbies, but I particularly enjoy playing board games, fishkeeping, building legos, watching movies and snowboarding.

I hope you enjoy your visit here and find something useful to you.
