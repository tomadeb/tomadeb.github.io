The latest [the Ergo](https://mailchi.mp/fc6479cc5582/the-ergo-signup) newsletter mentions a new and innovative superfamily of fonts for code called [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/). That was enough for me to click through and I really like it so far.

After some playing around, I have settled for Monaspace Krypton for my terminal emulator of choice, [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/):

```
font_family      Monaspace Krypton
bold_font        Monaspace Krypton SemiBold
italic_font      Monaspace Krypton Italic
bold_italic_font Monaspace Krypton SemiBold Italic
```

I spend a lot of time at the terminal (yes, by choice) and now it is even more enjoyable to use, thanks to Monaspace Krypton. 

As a slight digression, I recommend watching [Gary Hustwit](https://www.hustwit.com/)'s documentary [Helvetica](https://vimeo.com/ondemand/helvetica3).
