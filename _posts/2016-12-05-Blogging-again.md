I decided to start blogging again while listening to the (very good) episode 61 of Datanauts: [Trials & Tribulations Of Technical Blogging](http://packetpushers.net/podcast/podcasts/datanauts-061-trials-tribulations-technical-blogging/). It occurred to me that a blog could provide me with the right motivation to formalise some of my thoughts and projects. I have to admit that I have also not bseen writing all that much lately. I should make an effort to regularly document the technology I use and the projects I work on.

Don't get me wrong, I am not hoping to be read by anyone ... But something buried somewhere deep inside me still hopes that some of the content gathered here may be found and help someone. 

This site and its content is obviously a continuous work in progress. However, I am pretty sure that I will mainly be writing about a few technical subjects I am interested in - such as [Infosec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), [monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_monitoring) and [docker](https://www.docker.com/) for example - as well as the odd diggression or rant.

This site runs from [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), with the fantastic [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I am fairly new to it all, so this blog may be missing some of the usual features, such as comments or even a good about page. But as I said, work in progress ... 

Oh, and yes, I tend to overuse ellipses. I know it is a bad habit and I am working on it but I apologise in advance for all the unfinished sentences.

Thanks for reading.
