The tank is doing generally well although I think I am still struggling to get decent growth from my corals.

Here is the current stock:

Fish:
* 1 Royal gramma
* 1 Orchid dottyback
* 2 Black storm clown fish
* 1 While belly wrasse

Clean-up Crew:
* 1 Strawberry conch
* 1 cleaner shrimp
* 1 Fire shrimp
* 2 Emerald Crabs
* 3 Red Hermit crabs
* 5 Nassarius Snails
* Numerous Trochus snails

Corals and Anemones
* 2 Blastomusa
* 1 Flavia
* 1 Organ Pipe Coral
* 5 Zoas
* 1 War coral

The trochus snails are breeding and the tank has numerous baby snails, predominantly on the back wall and in the corners, where cleaning is a little more challenging.

Issues:
- Corals are not growing
- Corals are sometimes dying with no apparent reasons

Possible issues:
- Tank and Processes are not stable enough.
- Do I feed enough? Do I feed too much ?
- High nitrates
- High Phosphates

Routine:
- Daily
  * quick visual inspection of tank and cabinet
  * feed thawed frozen food twice
  * dose 5ml [All-For-Reef][2]
- Weekly
  * Test water parameters (Salinity, Alkalinity, Ph, NO2, NO3, NH3 + NH4, Phosphate)
- When Phosphates or MO3 are just too damn' high
  * Change 20% water
- Every 6 weeks:
  * Change Carbon and [Phosphate Minus][3] from reactor

Next Steps / ideas:
* Put [PhosGuard][5] the filter cup in the back chamber in order to reduce Phosphate
* Add [Zeo Mix][4] to reactor in order to reduce ammonia and therefore reduce Nitrate
* I'm not sure the TMC frozen food I currently use is of the best quality. I have a bit of a nutrient film. Maybe I should test the AquaForest food.
* Should I add another fish?!?!? maybe a bicolor blenny.
* Maybe another powerhead on the other side would increase and randomise flow.
